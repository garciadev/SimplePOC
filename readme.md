# Simple POC

This is just a Simple POC to play around with some of the features of ColdBox MVC.

Features include:

-   Using CommandBox to run this site (make sure you install all dependencies)
-   Calling pages/views by convention
-   Have a model make an external API call
-   Have the results of that external API call available on the default page
-   Set up a REST endpoint for making that external API call
-   Have the default page use jQuery to dynamically update the content by calling that REST endpoint
-   Set up REST endpoint to do some string checking
-   Add validation to rest call using the cbValidation module
-   Call the string check endpoint from a frontend page via jQuery (includes basic client side validation)
-   Define routes for calling the API endpoints
-   Write unit tests for the two model services
-   Write tests for calling the API endpoints
